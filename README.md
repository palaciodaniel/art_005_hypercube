**VERY IMPORTANT:** Neither *GitHub* nor *NBViewer* support the 'jgraph' library. In order to display the visualization, please enter the following [Binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/palaciodaniel/art_005_hypercube/main?filepath=art_005_hypercube.ipynb), and once the Notebook loads go to **Kernel > Restart and Run All**.

**How to 'play' with the hypercube:** 

Everything is made with the mouse.
- Keep the left button pressed and move it horizontally to rotate the hypercube clockwise/counter-clockwise.
- Keep the left button pressed and move it vertically to rotate the cube vertically.
- Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out.
- Keep the right button pressed and move it around the area to change the hypercube's position.

'play' with the hypercube by keeping pressed the left or right buttons from your mouse. Also you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out.
